# Enroute-Genie
IIW Project

1. **extractCities.py** : extract NER locations from blogsUrls for every pair of popular destinations
   + read **input/california.json** - collection of destinations from Google results of query : https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#q=popular+cities+in+california
   ```
   ["Anaheim", "Avalon", "Bakersfield", "Berkeley", "Beverly Hills", "Big Bear Lake", "Carlsbad", "Fresno", "Fremont", ...]
   ```
   + for every pair of destinations the query : 'places to visit between '  + city_a  + ' and '  + city_b + ' blogs' result links collected
   + for every bloglink content was extracted using beautiful soup
   + extracted text content was tagged with NER LOCATION using StandfordCoreNLP
   + output were recorded into json files for a pair city_a  + '_and_'  + city_b + '.json', 
    these can be found in **output_candidate_location_from_blogs_using_NER/california/**

    + get geoCode for src and destination from fileName format 'cityA' + '_and_' + 'cityB' + '.json'
