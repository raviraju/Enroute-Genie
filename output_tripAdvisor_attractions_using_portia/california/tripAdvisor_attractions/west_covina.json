        "knownFor": "\u201c Amazing Massage Plus Stretching \u201d Reviewed September 19, 2015 I am new to this area from NY. I have had a lot of massages. This Thai massage is by far my favorite. The masseuse (M?) applied pressure firmly but gently. And it was not only a massage but also a head to toe stretching of body muscles as well. I slept like a baby that night! Highly recommended! Helpful? 2 Thank EyshaShirrine Report",
