        "knownFor": "\u201c One of the nicest community parks in America \u201d Reviewed September 24, 2016 This is simply an amazing park that has it all. The lake is real. There are lighted team fields for all sports (maintained in excellent condition), trails to stretch the legs, play areas for kids, lots of places to hang out for a meal or just enjoy the sun/shade. You have to see it for yourself to understand just how... More Helpful? Thank Kauai-Biz-Traveler Report",
