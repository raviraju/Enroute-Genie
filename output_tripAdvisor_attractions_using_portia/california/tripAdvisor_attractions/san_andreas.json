        "knownFor": "\u201c laid back wine tasting \u201d Reviewed November 23, 2015 We found this place based on a temporary sign along the highway. Several signs later and up a gravel road. We found a fruit stand/ wine tasting place. Randy, the owner, was the nicest man. My boyfriend tasted and discussed wine with Randy while I checked out the produce and candles. It was very laid back. It was good wine... More Helpful? Thank Cheryl W Report",
