The decor makes you feel comfortable, the bartender was very nice and super speedy. The owners even bought us or first drinks. There is a lovely back patio on which we enjoyed our cocktails and felt like we belonged there as we made friends with total strangers. We can't wait to go back! Helpful? Thank Terriann H Report"
