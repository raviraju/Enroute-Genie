        "knownFor": "\u201c The show was great, theatre is old \u201d Reviewed May 21, 2016 The show was a charity event called Elvis Palooza. It was great. We really enjoyed it. The theater is old and needs updating, but it was fine for the show. It isn't very big so most seats are good. They have limited facilities. Limited snacks are available for purchase. Very casual. I would go again if there is a show... More Helpful? Thank daytrippergal Report",
