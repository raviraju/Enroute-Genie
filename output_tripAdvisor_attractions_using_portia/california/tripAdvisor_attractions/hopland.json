In fact, aside from the Solar Living Center and the Casino, that's the ONLY thing... But I am reviewing the GARDENS of Campovida. Its a very nice walk, something different to see depending what time of year you go. Apparently people have weddings there, too. The rest of the Campovida... More Helpful? Thank Kessalia19 Report"
