        "Skyline is a fabulous slice of nature featuring wonderful hikes and views of the surrounding area. It offers rv sites and tent camping. I believe the entry fee is $5/car.",
        "We will make a hike up this trail a regular event each time we visit Napa. My husband and I took a picnic lunch (provided by Oxbow Market) and took a 45 min. trail to Lake Maria."
