A major landmark in the area is the man-made Nicasio Reservoir. Nicasio is scenically very attractive with forested and open ridgelines surrounding a wide rolling valley. The area along Lucas Valley Road follows a narrow valley with mostly forested hillsides above it. Oak, bay, and fir trees are common in the area, and along some of the creeks stands of redwoods are still found. Wildlife is abundant; the Nicasio chickadee, a subspecies of the chestnut-backed chickadee, was named by Robert Ridgway. Three main roads cross the area: Lucas Valley Road, Nicasio Valley Road, and the Point Reyes-Petaluma Road. Important pieces of public land in the surrounding area include Point Reyes National Seashore, portions of the Golden Gate National Recreation Area, and Samuel P. Taylor State Park. Within the Nicasio area are about 250 homes located on approximately 350 parcels. Much of the land is still used for agricultural purposes including beef and dairy cattle grazing, small-scale truck farming (including organic farming), and the raising of forage. Several small vineyards have also been recently established. Next to Rancho Nicasio within the town of Nicasio is an organic farm, AllStar Organics, owned and operated by Janet Brown and Marty Jacobson; Janet is the vice-president of Marin Organic, Marin County's non-profit organic association. Just north of Nicasio Reservoir is Fairlea Ranch, , where pedigree longhorn cattle are raised. The most significant non-agricultural business within Nicasio is George Lucas' Skywalker Ranch, a part of Lucasfilm Ltd. Population estimates for the area range from about 600 to about 900 people. According to a 2004 Forbes magazine real estate survey, Nicasio is the 23rd most expensive zip code in the US. Centrally located in this area is the small village of Nicasio itself. The village is in 415/628. The town center has a post office (zip code 94946), a general store, a tiny real estate office, St. Mary's Church (established in 1867), Nicasio Volunteer Fire Department, a baseball field located in the town square, Rancho Nicasio, which is a bar/restaurant/live music establishment, a Druid's Hall, as well as a number of private homes. The town was founded in the early 19th century to support local agricultural, timber, and fishing activities. The town once boasted the twenty-two-room Hotel Nicasio, which opened in 1867 but burned down in December 1940. Just north of town on Nicasio Valley Road is a beautiful red-painted one-room schoolhouse that opened in 1871. The building is currently a listed historical landmark. The Nicasio post office opened in 1871, closed in 1899, and re-opened in 1900. In 2008 Dewey Livingston wrote a detailed history of the region, Nicasio: The Historic Valley at the Center of Marin."

However, Plumas Lake stands as a separate community. Many individuals and agencies (including the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers) were opposed to the construction of this project due to the history of severe (15+ feet of standing water) flooding. Notable floods in the area occurred in 1986 and 1997. The flood risk in the area was exacerbated by hydraulic mining which occurred in the Yuba River watershed upstream of the region. Mine tailings wound up in the river beds and were then transported into the Sacramento Valley, where they accumulated in the river channels and reduced their conveyance capacities. This mining activity was part of the Gold Rush of California. A park and ride facility was opened on October 1, 2009 by Caltrans in the Plumas Lake area, along California State Route 70 and Feather River Blvd."

The largest centers of the urban area maintain global city status and as a whole the metropolitan region is host to 13 consulates from Asian, European, North American, Oceanian, and South American nations. Over forty million people cross the border each year between Tijuana and San Diego, giving the region the busiest land-border crossing in the world. Since the implementation of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) in 1994, San Diego–Tijuana has become a dominant commercial center in the United States and Mexico. The economic success of globalization has allowed San Diego–Tijuana to grow to the third richest region in the Californias, with a GDP of $136.3 billion in 2002. Renowned for natural beauty, tourism is a leading industry in the region and its coastal environs have been paramount factors in the growth of action sports-lifestyle companies. Other key industries include military, biotech, and manufacturing. San Diego–Tijuana traces its European roots to 1542 when the land was explored by Portuguese explorers on behalf of imperial Spain. In 1601 it was mandated by the Spanish viceroy in Mexico City that safe ports be found, one of which would be San Diego Bay, for returning Spanish trade ships from Manila to Acapulco. During this mission, the explorer Sebastián Vizcaíno was also told to map the California coast in great detail; leading to the further exploration of the modern day site of San Diego–Tijuana."

Two California state prisons for adults (California Institution for Men and California Institution for Women), as well as the Heman G. Stark Youth Correctional Facility, lie within the city limits. The land grant on which the town was founded was called Rancho Santa Ana del Chino. Santa Ana is Spanish for Saint Anne, but the exact meaning of ""Chino"" has been explained in different ways. One explanation is that the ""Chino"" (curly-haired person or mixed-race person) was the chief of the local Native American village. The president of the Chino Valley Historical Society, drawing on US Civil War-era letters, designates the ""curl"" referenced in the toponym as that at the top of the grama grass that abounded in the valley."

The city grew slowly prior to World War II but the war effort saw the construction of the Oxnard Army Air Field (later Oxnard Air Force Base in 1951, now Camarillo Airport) to the west of town. The community also grew as the new base along with nearby Naval Air Station Point Mugu and a Seabee base at Port Hueneme brought many workers and their families to the area. The grounds of Camarillo State Hospital, which opened in 1936 south of town, are now the campus of California State University, Channel Islands. As with most cities in Ventura County, it is noted for its resistance to new development. In 2014, the council voted against an 895-acre project that would have extended development on agricultural lands east towards the Conejo Grade."

It is located in the eastern San Gabriel Valley, at the foothills of the San Gabriel Mountains. The Claremont Colleges are located in the city. The population, as of the 2014 United States Census, is 36,054. Claremont is known for its many educational institutions, its tree-lined streets, and its historic buildings. In July 2007, it was rated by CNN/Money magazine as the fifth best place to live in the United States, and was the highest rated place in California on the list. Due to its large number of trees and residents with doctoral degrees, it is sometimes referred to as ""The City of Trees and PhDs"". The city is primarily residential, with a significant portion of its commercial activity revolving around ""The Village"", a popular collection of street-front small stores, boutiques, art galleries, offices, and restaurants adjacent to and west of the Claremont Colleges. The Village was expanded in 2007, adding a controversial multi-use development that includes a cinema, a boutique hotel, retail space, offices, and a parking structure on the site of an old citrus packing plant just west of Indian Hill Boulevard. Some critics say that the expansion negatively altered the original, small-town feel of The Village. Claremont has been a winner of the National Arbor Day Association's Tree City USA award for 22 consecutive years. When the city incorporated in 1907, local citizens started what has since become the city's tree-planting tradition. Claremont is one of the few remaining places in North America with American Elm trees that have not been exposed to Dutch elm disease. The stately trees line Indian Hill Boulevard in the vicinity of the city's Memorial Park. The Claremont Institute, a conservative think tank, is located there. Several retirement communities, among them Pilgrim Place, the Claremont Manor and Mt. San Antonio Gardens, are also located in Claremont."

Throughout the 20th century, it was one of the fastest-growing regions in the United States, although growth has slowed since 2000. As of the 2010 U.S. Census, the Los Angeles Metropolitan Statistical Area had a population of nearly 13 million residents. Meanwhile, the larger metropolitan region's population at the 2010 census was estimated to be over 17.8 million residents, and a 2014 estimate reported a population of about 18.5 million. Either definition makes it the second largest metropolitan region in the country, behind the New York metropolitan area, as well as one of the largest urban agglomerations in the world. The agglomeration of the urbanized Greater Los Angeles area surrounds the urban core of Los Angeles County. The regional term is defined to refer to the more-or-less continuously urbanized area stretching from Ventura County to the southern border of Orange County and from the Pacific Ocean to the Coachella Valley in the Inland Empire. The US Census Bureau defines the Greater Los Angeles area to include the entire Los Angeles County, Ventura County, Orange County and the two counties of the Inland Empire, making up the ""Los Angeles-Long Beach-Riverside, CA"" Combined Statistical Area. However this Census definition includes large, sparsely populated and primarily desert swaths of Los Angeles, San Bernardino and Riverside counties that are not part of the urbanized region. The term ""Greater Los Angeles"" does not include San Diego and Imperial counties, whose urbanized areas are not geographically continuous with the urbanized area surrounding Los Angeles. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the Los Angeles metropolitan area has a total area of 4,850 square miles (12,561 km2), while the wider combined statistical area covers 33,954 square miles (87,940 km2), making it the largest metropolitan region in the United States by land area. However, more than half of this area lies in the sparsely populated eastern areas of Riverside and San Bernardino counties. In addition to being the nexus of the world's largest entertainment industry, Greater Los Angeles is also a global center of business, international trade, education, media, fashion, tourism, science and technology, sports, and transportation."

The Spanish called it ""lumpoco."" In 1837, the Mexican government granted the land around Lompoc as the Rancho Lompoc land grant. After the United States gained control of California in the Mexican-American War, the valley was acquired by Thomas Dibblee, Albert Dibblee and William Welles Hollister, the latter of whom sold his portion to the Lompoc Valley Land Company. It is from that portion that the present-day Lompoc was established as a temperance colony.

Palos Verdes is also particularly well known for its high-performing schools, with various national publications ranking the high school between 8th and 44th best in the nation in the 2000s and 2010s. The city is located along the Southern California coastline of the Pacific Ocean. There are several accessible beaches although most of the predominantly rocky shoreline is marked by high cliffs. Three noteworthy Palos Verdes Estates surfriding beaches exist among the estate homes along the coastline, and include: Haggerty's (the rock beach below the Neighborhood Church of Palos Verdes, site of the former Haggerty Manor estate), the Palos Verdes Bluff Cove Beach (around the point, south of Haggerty's, which includes ""indicator"", ""little reef"", ""middle"", and ""boneyard"" surf breaks), and Lunada Bay (occasional large winter waves). Other significant features of the city are the scenic Palos Verdes Golf Club, a challenging 18-hole golf course and country club designed by George C. Thomas Jr and William ""Billy"" Bell in 1923, and the Palos Verdes Tennis Club. Both premier facilities are restricted for recreational use by city resident-members and guests, and are centrally located within the city. Another popular city landmark atop Palos Verdes Estates is the La Venta Inn. Built in 1923, La Venta Inn was the first known building structure on the Palos Verdes Peninsula. Architects Walter and Pierpont Davis designed the building and the famous landscape architects, the Olmstead brothers, designed its gardens. The La Venta Inn has views of the Southern California coastline."

Spreckels is one of the best-preserved company towns in the United States. It was built to house workers for the Spreckels Sugar Company plant which operated there from 1899 until 1982, named after its founder ""Sugar King"" Claus Spreckels. When it opened, the Spreckels plant was the world's largest sugar beet factory, each day consuming 13 million gallons of water (much of it pumped from wells) to process 3000 tons of beets. Spreckels is associated with the writer John Steinbeck, who lived and worked there for a time, and used it as a setting in Tortilla Flat. (Spreckels was used as a location for the 1955 Steinbeck movie East of Eden.) In 2004, controversy erupted in Spreckels when the Tanimura family, which owns the fields around the town, declared that a 1907 plat in its possession gave it the right to build 73 housing units on its land—-an act which would increase the town's size by 40%. A legal battle over the status and definition of ""antiquated maps"" ensued. In an out-of-court settlement, the Tanimura company agreed to a requirement that the houses maintain the style and spirit of the town. Although the lots have white picket fences and landscaping, developers failed to avoid a ""cookie-cutter"" design. The new homes are large and set close together and generally uniform in appearance."

It is located in the Corral de Tierra Valley, on the former land grant of Corral de Tierra, at an elevation of 404 feet (123 m). A post office operated at Corral de Tierra from 1912 to 1931, with moves in 1918 and 1929. The name is from the land grant. The first person, other than the native Indians, to wander into what is now Corral de Tierra Valley was an unnamed Spanish Corporal in 1776. He had been sent in pursuit of some Rumsen Indians who had escaped from the San Carlos Mission. In his quest he came upon the valley. During the Mexican Rancho era the rancheros periodically used a box canyon in the upper valley to hold some of their livestock. No trace of the corral remains today except that the present district carries on the name. The valley remained a wilderness until April 10, 1836 when Nicolas Gutierrez granted one league (4,434 acres) to Francisco Figueroa for his daughter Guadalupe. The rancho was bordered on the south by the Los Laurelos grant in 1844. The U.S. Lands Commission finally granted the Corral de Tierra to Henry D. McCobb on January 21, 1876. The rancho lay, for the most part, outside the boundaries of the valley that bears its name, except for Calera Canyon, at its center. Closely entwined with the history of Corral de Tierra is the Rancho El Toro (5,668 acres) within which the part of the present-day Markham Ranch is situated. El Toro was granted to Jose Ramon Estrada in 1835 and patented to Charles Wolters in 1862. There were two schools in the Valley. Washington, at about mid-valley, was established in 1873, and by 1880 had 116 students. The other school was Lincoln School at approximately the intersection of Underwood and Corral de Tierra road built in 1887. It survived for years but was recently torn down. As time passed and the original land owners passed on or otherwise sold their land, a series of wealthy men bought up the old homesteads. Among them were Andrew Molera, David Jacks and Tom Work. In 1913, C.N. Thorup, a realtor, reacting to the possibility of oil in the Corral de Tierra area, leased 1,403 acres from the Titus and Bramers families to explore that possibility. There is no record of any economically feasible amount ever being found and the leases were allowed to expire. Development was slow in Corral de Terra until 1959 when the founders of the Corral de Tierra Country Club purchased 120 acres from W.B. Grainger and built the clubhouse and golf course. Homer Hayward was the Club’s first president. This spurred a rush to build homes in the area. That sale and a sale by the Ferrini family of their property along the west side of Highway 68 caused a rash of development in Toro Park, San Benancio, and Corral de Tierra. These early developments soon led to approval by Monterey County of the Coral de Tierra Oaks subdivision on April 28, 1965. Alan Pattee and the Robley family also owned considerable acreage in Corral de Tierra and it was subdivided into upscale estate lots. In the 1960s the Chamisal Country Club was developed and the area has continued to grow. In the last half century, small neighborhoods have been built in the valleys running off the Monterey-Salinas Highway, and a sense of independent identity and community has formed among the residents in the community of Corral de Tierra, California 93908. There are now approximately 13,500 residents in the Toro Park, San Benancio and Corral de Tierra districts."

The name honors Samuel Fales who purchased the natural hot springs in 1863 and developed the site into a resort in 1877. The Fales post office operated for a period during 1881. By 1908, Fales Hot Springs had a stage coach stop and baths using the hot spring water. According to Ella Cain, a resident of Bodie in the 1890s and of Bridgeport in later years, Sam Fales was in the business of telling tall tales to his dinner guests extract from The Story of Mono County. According to the records at the Mono County Museum in Bridgeport, Sam Fales transferred control of the facilities to J.M. Mawer in 1908, but lived at the hot springs until his death in 1933 at the age of 104. The resort remained in use under various owners until it exploded in a Butane filling accident in 1952, see Mono County Historical Society Newsletter 2011. As of 2009, the resort is undergoing restoration. The current resort was constructed in 1954 using the settlement money from the 1952 accident and is located about 1/4 mile north of the original stage stop. Only 2 other residences can be seen from the resort in spite of a panoramic vista to the West. It is common for drivers on US-395 to stop in Bridgeport to report a fire, having been fooled by the steam rising from Hot Creek. Several attempts have been made to exploit the minerals around the Hot Spring without success. Travertine deposits are described as too porous to be usable. Some amount of Uranium was discovered by the DOE, but does not appear to have been mined. A 413 feet (126 m) deep test well did not yield water hotter than 100 °F (38 °C). The water from the spring is reported as 180 °F (82 °C)."

After the gold in the surface gravels in the area was largely worked out, hard rock gold mining began in 1856 when J. J. Meachum, Titicum and others established the California mine. The mine proved profitable. McKee & Henderson erected a nearby mill which reportedly crushed 15,000 tons of rock before it burned down in 1863. The crushed rock yielded 8 to 9 dollars a ton in gold. Alongside mining, a thriving lumbering industry developed, and a number of sawmills were erected. The rough and tumble of mining camp life surfaced quickly in Gaston, when one partner in a mining venture killed the other, and not over gold. One newspaper described the killing as follows: ""On Sunday evening last a man named [Valentine] Brand was murdered by Wm. [or Warren] Myers, at Gaston Ridge in Eureka township. The difficulty grew out of a foot- race in which Myers was one of the runners and Brand acted as judge. The decision was given against Myers, who became offended and quarreled with Brand. Myers then left and arming himself with a rifle, returned and deliberately shot Brand through the body, inflicting a wound from the effects of which he died the next day. Myers was immediately taken into custody"".A jury convicted Myers of only second degree murder, apparently out of a concern that Myers may not have been sane. Over the years, the California mine was generally profitable and was regularly expanded. An ample supply of water was insured by the arrival of the North Bloomfield ditch in 1870. By 1897, an estimated $600,000 in gold, at then prices, had been produced. Still, the mine changed hands several times, in the process becoming known as the Gaston Mine. In 1898, the mine was acquired by the Gaston Gold Mining Company, based in San Francisco. Initially well financed, that company invested in new equipment and substantially upgraded operations. Employment increased from 20 men in 1898 to 50 men in 1900 and 90 men in early 1907. With the increase in mining operations and employment, a town blossomed around the mine. The population was recorded as about 200 in 1900. There was stage service initially to the town of Washington, and later daily service to Nevada City. By 1904, the town boasted two stores, a hotel, a saloon, a hardware store, a post office, a water system, a fire company and a school. Electric lights arrived that year, and joined a telephone line to Nevada City. Soon, a group of Italian immigrants arrived to work in the mine creating a ""New Town"" below the ""Old Town"". Many of the Italians were employed to cut wood and produce charcoal for use in the mine’s forges. The post office was established in 1899. Mary Harmon was its first postmaster and the first female postmaster in Nevada County. Ellen Whitaker was appointed postmaster in 1904. The post office was discontinued in 1913. There were other mines around the Gaston Ridge, such as the Baltic, Ethel and Erie Mines, but the principal gold producer in the area was the Gaston Mine. Between 1899 and 1907, the mine produced about $1 million in gold at then prices. The mine was shut down temporarily in 1907, a result of the severe winter, and a shortage of capital attributed to the cost of drilling the long tunnel and the aftermath of the San Francisco earthquake. It reopened in 1909, and operated intermittently for the next few years. In 1916, it became the first mine in Nevada County to install the new Hardinge Mill, which improved the gold extraction process. The mine closed during World War I, because of a shortage of labor and supplies needed for the war effort. There was intermittent mining after the war. By the 1940s, the last remaining building was in shambles. After World War II, the area was heavily logged. Today, nothing readily visible remains of Gaston. Gannett may have confused Gaston with Fort Gaston, located in northwestern California, and named after a Lt. Gaston killed during an Indian skirmish."

It is located on the north bank of the Merced River 6 miles (9.7 km) east of Snelling, at an elevation of 348 feet (106 m).Merced Falls was named for a set of rapids on the Merced River. A post office operated at Merced Falls from 1856 to 1957. The town was founded here because in the California Gold Rush, the three main crossings of the Merced River on the Stockton - Los Angeles Road were located within 2 miles (3.2 km) downstream of the rapids of Merced Falls. Closest to the falls was Phillips' Ferry, then Belts Ferry (later Murray's Ferry and Murray's Bridge and near what later became Merced Falls), and then Young's Ferry. Murray's Bridge was washed away in the Great Flood of 1862 but was later rebuilt. The rapids of Merced Falls was used in the 1890s to power several watermills located in the town. A pair of sawmills in Merced Falls cut wood for the Yosemite and Sugar Pine Lumber Company, which shipped lumber down from the Sierra Nevada on the Yosemite Valley Railroad. The city continued to function well into the 1920s as a hub for tourists travelling into Yosemite Valley via the railroad. With the construction of the Central Pacific Railroad north-south across the Central Valley, many towns including Merced Falls that were not on the railroad fell into disrepair. The rapids themselves were inundated by McSwain Dam, built across the Merced River in the 1960s. Merced Falls is now surrounded by irrigated farmland, and the community itself is almost abandoned."

A post office operated at Pino Grande from 1892 to 1899, with a move in 1893, and from 1902 to 1909. Pino Grande was the lumber milling area for the Michigan California Lumber company. Besides the mill there were dozens of workers cabins, a hospital, school, cooks building, machine shops and sheds. The camp was, in itself, a small town. The narrow gauge railroad the lumber company built served the area for decades. The mill, camp, railroad, tracks, trestles, engines, rollingstock, etc., are now long gone. The area where Pino Grande once stood is within the Eldorado National Forest. The Pino Grande Railroad traveled along the narrow gauge track through the Georgetown Divide area. These narrow gauge railroads hauled vast amounts of Ponderosa and Sugar Pine timber through the rugged terrain of the Divide as well as other parts of El Dorado County. In 1892 the American Land and Lumber Co., later to be the Michigan-California Lumber Co., brought in the first locomotives to run on narrow gauge track through the canyons of the Divide. Trestles were built around curves in the mountains and across canyons. The little locomotives that ran the rails of the Michigan-California Lumber Co. were mostly Shays, small steamers usually weighing around 65,000 pounds, but built to pull the heaviest loads. There were other types of locomotives used, the Heisler and the Climax, but the Shay was the workhorse of the Michigan-California Lumber Company. Shay No. 2, the oldest engine in the Michigan-Cal line, retired in 1951 and is now resting outside the mill in Camino where narrow gauge railroad buffs visit it often. Today, on the Georgetown Divide, the Canyon Creek Narrow Gauge Railroad Association has planned to resurrect the old Pino Grande narrow gauge railroad that was owned and operated by Michigan-California Lumber Co."

Currently the most active are geo-thermal leases looking for alternative energy. Much of the old check-board ownership has been consolidated into and umbrella ownership within California State Parks. In the last legislative session, the current a future land use questions were largely answered as the legislature divided the area into two management units. The northern-most one is administered by Anza-Borrego Desert State Park and largely precludes the use of motorized vehicle except street legal and then only for basic access to the canyon floors. The southern portion is administered by Ocotillo Wells State Vehicular Recreation Area (also part of the Park System) which does allow use of motorized vehicles. The southern portion has been widely used a vehicle recreation site for many decades. The area is the northern section of the Borrego Maneuver Area (BMA) administered by the US Navy during and after World War II. The Truckhaven area was only used as a far down range impact area for anti-aircraft gunnery and moderate artillery fire occurring much further south in the vicinity of Borrego Mountain and Military Wash. No evidence has come to light so far (as of 2011) that there are any unexploded ordnance (UXO) in the Truckhaven area."

When the first road was built to Linn's Valley, Dogtown was moved a mile and a half west to the road. Its name was changed to Tailholt after one of the first stagecoaches to stop in town provided the new name, due to a humorous incident. It involved a lady passenger on the stagecoach that grabbed the tail of her dog as it jumped out the window in pursuit of a cat. She hung on screaming for help until the owner of the local restaurant, Mother Cummings, came to her rescue. While she was lifting the dog through the window of the coach she said, ""Well Ma'am, a tail-holt is better than a no holt at all"". The coach driver, Yank, on his return to Visalia told the postmaster and keeper of the stage station there that the new name of the town was Tailholt. Its name was later changed to the more respectable title of White River. Among the points of interest are two cemeteries, one north of the river for regular citizens, and a small one, the Tailholt Boot Hill Cemetery, south of the river for those the town did not want in their cemetery, like Jack Gordon, (formerly Peter Worthington), who died violently in a gunfight and was a known member of the Mason Henry Gang."

Wilseyville's post office was established in 1947; it has the zip code 95257. Wilseyville was named after Lawrence A. Wilsey, an executive at the American Forest Products Company. Wilseyville is notorious for being the location of the ranch where serial killers Leonard Lake and Charles Ng killed and disposed of some of their victims. Their spree ended in June 1985, when Ng was spotted loading stolen merchandise into a car driven by Lake in South San Francisco. Ng fled, but Lake was arrested at the scene for illegally outfitting a .22 revolver with a silencer. He swallowed a cyanide pill while in police custody and died four days later. Police found human remains and other evidence at the Wilseyville ranch and began a manhunt for Ng. He was arrested in Canada while shoplifting and was extradited to the United States after serving a sentence in Canada. Ng was sentenced to death after being found guilty of 11 of 12 counts of murder. It was later ruled that Lake and Ng were responsible for the 12th victim, though they are thought to have killed as many as 25 people."

The weather station was 1,600 feet (490 m) above sea level. The location is on the San Andreas Fault, according to the U.S. Geological Survey, and it experienced considerable damage in the 1906 San Francisco earthquake. Geologists observed a lateral displacement of 4.6 feet (1.4 m) at Wrights. Wrights is one of a number of ghost towns in the Santa Cruz Mountains that flourished during the last half of the nineteenth century. Laurel, Wrights, Glenwood, and Clems declined when the Los Gatos-Santa Cruz railroad ceased operations in March 1940. Later in 1940, Patchen was bypassed and isolated by the construction of State Route 17; since the late 1960s it has been a Christmas tree ranch.

The Brockway post office operated from 1901 to 1966. The name honors Nathaniel Brockway, uncle of the first postmaster. Brockway was one of the first places settled at Lake Tahoe by American immigrants to California after the first Trans-Continental Railroad, which passed 12 miles north of the lake, through Truckee. The first road built to transport tourists from the Truckee railstop to Lake Tahoe was over Brockway summit (Highway 267), and ended at the Brockway pier, where steamers could take visitors to other locations. Soon afterwards, a spur railroad was built to Tahoe City from Truckee, and it became the first real resort community at the lake. (The old railroad grade is now a bicycle path along the Truckee River.) Brockway has the only hot springs at Lake Tahoe, right at the shore. Old ""grain grinding holes"" (Washo: gámuŋ ) are visible in massive talus boulders along the shore. A ""commodious"" hotel was constructed around 1869, shortly after the completion of the road over Brockway Summit. Brockway was once located in two different states as surveyors establishing the California-Nevada border (which makes its turn to the north in the middle of the lake) mistakenly placed the line a half mile west of its proper location, placing Brockway in Nevada. It was eventually corrected. The Brockway community grew and numerous homes were built in the 1920s and 30's. In the 1930s and 40's, Brockway attracted Hollywood celebrities."

Martin first homesteaded the area in 1851 and operated a tollgate and station for stagecoaches crossing the mountains. Later he developed a lumber mill, winery, store, and the Glenwood Resort Hotel. It was known as Martinville until the establishment of the post office on August 23, 1880. Glenwood was a stop on the narrow gauge South Pacific Coast Railroad, which began service from Alameda (north terminus, with a ferry to San Francisco) to Felton in 1880. At Felton, the SPC bought and connected to the former Felton & Santa Cruz Railroad tracks, which ran the remaining six miles southwards through Santa Cruz and out onto a wharf on Monterey Bay. To minimize length and steepness, six tunnels were dug through ridges of the Santa Cruz Mountains. ""Tunnel Number 2"" exited at Glenwood. The railroad was acquired in the 1880s by the Southern Pacific, which broad-gauged the line in the early 1900s. The April 18, 1906, earthquake twisted some of the rails and damaged bridges and tunnels along the line. The Southern Pacific repaired the railroad and it continued operations until March 1940. The routing of State Route 17, completed during 1940, bypassed Glenwood, contributing to its decline. Glenwood officially ""disappeared"" with the closing of the U.S. post office in 1954. By 1990 the town had but one resident left, Mrs. Margaret Koch, who is the great-granddaughter of the founder, and served as last postmaster. The area is now sparsely settled. Glenwood Drive, also known as Glenwood Highway, passes through the site of the town."

It is located on the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railroad 11.5 miles (19 km) northwest of Atwater, at an elevation of 141 feet (43 m). Founding Some of California's early agricultural colonies owe their birth to the idealism of Abiko Kyutaro. Born in Niigata Prefecture Japan in 1865, he was raised by his grandfather in less than favorable economic conditions. At seventeen he moved to Tokyo with hopes jumping on a ship to America, but he ended up working there for a few years instead. During this time he became devout Christian and then came to America as a student in 1885, like several other initial Japanese immigrants. A decade later, Abiko became a somewhat of a successful businessman and began his personal mission to aid other fellow Japanese in settling in the United States. In 1899 his news paper entitled Nichibei Shimbun became the most prominent Japanese newspaper. The paper took on issues such as restrictions on Japanese immigration and education discrimination. Abiko’s paper not only helped publicize issues important to Japanese Americans, but it also created ties among newly formed Japanese communities. As Abiko became a prominent leader in the Japanese American community, he formed three new colonies: Yamato Colony in Livingston in 1907, Cressey in 1918, and Cortez in 1919. Legal Loopholes When Cortez was founded in 1919, another piece (in a long history) of anti-Japanese legislation had been passed in the United States. The Alien Land Act of 1913 prevented all ‘aliens illegible for citizenship’ from owning land or leasing property for more than three years. This act was a direct attempt to prevent Japanese farmers from owning land and therefore accumulating wealth in their names. Options for social mobility became limited. The farmers of the Abiko colonies were fortunate compared to many other Japanese; they were farm owners in addition to being farm laborers. In order to circumvent this law, many Japanese out their farm’s land in the name of their Nisei American born children. Families were able to turn barren uncultivated land into thriving farms through hard work ethic and by running a family economy. It was normative for all members of a family, including children would work on the farm."

About half of East Palo Alto's residents were African Americans in 1990, which was the result of redlining practices and racial deed restrictions in Palo Alto. Latinos now constitute about 65% of the total population, while the proportion of African Americans has decreased to about 15%[dubious – discuss]. A small minority of Pacific Islanders also reside in East Palo Alto, most of Tongan, Samoan and Indo-Fijian origin.[citation needed]. East Palo Alto has the largest concentration of Pacific Islanders of any American city or town outside of Hawaii[citation needed]. In the past, East Palo Alto experienced profound crime and poverty, especially during the 1980s and early 1990s. In 1992, it had the highest homicide rate in the country with 24,322 people, and 42 murders, equaling a rate of 172.7 homicides per 100,000 residents. Since then the city's crime problems have subsided, and the murder rate in particular has declined to a typical urban level. In 2006, East Palo Alto experienced a comparatively low six murders, seven in 2007, and only five in 2008. The prosperity that benefited the Silicon Valley during the dot-com boom of the late 1990s largely bypassed East Palo Alto. The Ravenswood City School District, which serves East Palo Alto and part of adjoining Menlo Park, has struggled with low academic performance.[citation needed] Eventually, however, the Peninsula's shortage of land and soaring property prices meant that even East Palo Alto became an option for urban regeneration. Until recently, gentrification has been rare in East Palo Alto. East Palo Alto also includes a small piece of land across the Bayshore Freeway (US 101) from the shopping center, a roughly triangular area between US 101 and San Francisquito Creek, which includes a former two-block-long retail business district known as Whiskey Gulch. The name dates back to the time that Stanford University, in Palo Alto to the west, was dry and prohibited alcohol sales within a radius of one mile (1.6 km) from the campus; Whiskey Gulch was just outside the limits, and was home to a number of liquor stores and bars. The city has torn down Whiskey Gulch and replaced it with the University Circle office complex. A 200-room Four Seasons hotel opened in University Circle in 2006. Over 25% of East Palo Alto (400+ acres) has been bulldozed and replaced with brand new housing and brand-name retail establishments over the last 10–15 years, including IKEA, Sports Authority, Home Depot, Nordstrom Rack, Togo's, Starbucks, Office Depot, Mi Pueblo Grocery, PGA Tour Superstore, 6 to 9 Dental, Jamba Juice and Izzy's Brooklyn Bagels, attracting an entirely new demographic. The University Square community has become particularly appealing to young high-tech professionals and high-income couples, including many employees from Google, Facebook, Sun Microsystems, and various other software and startup companies."

Zachariah ""Buffalo"" Jones bought the mill for $3000 and laid out a town called ""Jones Mill"". In 1860 John P. Hennings bought some of the property and changed the name to Lexington, after his home town of Lexington, Kentucky. Lexington was a stop on the stagecoach route from Los Gatos to Santa Cruz. In the 1860s, the saw mills moved up into the hills and Lexington began to lose importance. In 1880, a narrow gauge railroad from Los Gatos to Santa Cruz was completed, bypassing Lexington and accelerating its decline; its post office had already been transferred to Alma, a mile south, where the trains stopped and which was the transfer point to stagecoaches until the line was completed. The railroad ceased operations in March 1940, following major damage by a winter storm and the completion of State Route 17 that same year. When the Lexington Reservoir was created in 1952, both Lexington and Alma were officially abandoned and SR 17 was rerouted to its present location. The visible ruins under Lexington Reservoir are actually those of Alma, not Lexington; building foundations and original pavements of roads are sometimes visible during droughts. The nearby unincorporated town of Lexington Hills is a reminder of the former town; it combines several villages in the Santa Cruz Mountains. The Lexington Murders was one of the most notable crimes in California during the 19th century.

Like many of the now forgotten travel lodges in the area, it is remembered as a place people would flock to for good times. Particularly folks would gather for music and dances that would last until the sun came up over Turner Mountain. There were horseshoe pits, ping pong tables, card games (cribbage was the favorite), even slot machines to entertain the guests. At one time there was a small school house and sawmill. Aside from the travelers, locals came from many miles around not only to eat, buy gas and groceries, but also to sell their fruits, vegetables, and handicrafts to the store. Although most of the known history of this place revolves around the time in which it was an operating resort, evidence suggests the locale was utilized by indigenous people and the earliest maps indicate this location has always been a waypoint for people traveling through the area. Lassen Lodge's location is very convenient and important for a couple of reasons; it is situated on a broad, relatively flat ridge that straddles both Battle Creek Canyon and the north fork of the Payne's Creek watershed at a critical pass that connected the valley foothills with the mountains. Situated at the timberline, very large, well spaced trees and little underbrush provided an open shady area ideal for cattle to rest, and travelers to camp. Water was available from nearby springs that pour out of the side of the mountains, and at the turn of the century, ""The Last Chance"" ditch passed through this location carrying water from Battle Creek to the Champion Mill in Lyonsville. At 4,200 ft elevation, the weather is temperate, typically at the snowline during winter months and just above the heat in the summer. The Tehama County Wagon Road, and eventually highway 36, passed through and intersected with the Belle Mill Rd (now Tramway Rd) at this location. This intersection sits at a logical rest spot on the road where eastbound travelers would have just climbed two very steep grades, first the Buckeye grade from Paynes Creek to the rim of Battle Creek Canyon, then the steep grade from Ponderosa road up to Lassen Lodge."

It was established in 1887, in the Warm Springs Valley northwest of the town of Lake Elsinore, and later incorporated into the City of Lake Elsinore. Coal, along with clay deposits, was found on the site by John D. Huff in the late 1880s, and the Southern California Coal and Clay Company was formed to mine them. The town site of Terra Cotta was laid out and was given a post office on October 26, 1887. In May 1893 its post office was closed and moved to Lake Elsinore. A plant for the manufacture of sewer and water pipes was built using the coal to fire ceramic pipes in the four kilns. The finished product had to be shipped by wagon six miles through Lake Elsinore to the La Laguna rail station at the mouth of Railroad Canyon until 1896 when a spur line was built through Lake Elsinore and Terra Cotta to the new clay deposits in Alberhill. The coal mined was also used locally as fuel for the stamping mill at the Good Hope Mine and was shipped elsewhere in the state. Almost abandoned in 1901, Terra Cotta was revived in 1906 when the California Fireproof Construction Company built a new plant there to make ceramic pipes. In 1912, the plant was closed; by 1925, it was closed down, along with most of the buildings in the town. The clay mine in the town site continued to be operated by the Pacific Clay Products Company until 1940, when they transferred all their operations to Alberhill.

The school provides a sense of community for the town and the surrounding rural agricultural area that lies within the Somis Union School District boundary. Several structures have been designated County of Ventura Landmarks. The Camarillo station is the nearest stop for Amtrak and Metrolink trains and is served by Amtrak's Pacific Surfliner from San Luis Obispo to San Diego and Metrolink's Ventura County Line from Los Angeles Union Station to east Ventura. Somis Road (State Route 34), as the main thoroughfare, is lined with a few shops, businesses and a county fire station and intersects State Route 118 (Los Angeles Avenue) just north of town after crossing Fox Barranca. The railroad, which is parallel with Los Angeles Avenue between Somis and Moorpark, turns and becomes parallel with Somis Road at the south end of town where they located the railroad stop for shipping agricultural products. The tracks continue south to the Camarillo Station and the intersection with US 101. The original name of Somis Road has been changed though to Lewis Road a little over 1 mile (1.6 km) south of town at the northern boundary of the City of Camarillo which is also generally the southerly boundary of Rancho Las Posas. Shown as Central Avenue on the original plat filed by Bard, Somis Road runs in a north-south direction through the middle of the townsite. The parallel roads on either side are named West Street and East Street. Three streets are oriented in an east-west direction. The most northerly, named North Street, was extended northwesterly with plats filed in 1948 and 1953 that subdivided additional town lots. No further subdivision of town lots has occurred after this post-World War II expansion of the townsite to 96 acres (39 ha).(p194) As of 2000, the total population was 2,946 It is primarily an agricultural area, but is home to a hardware store, a market with a Mexican cafe, a post office, an elementary school, several shops, a small animal hospital, one main residential tract and numerous estates and ranches. It has no formal local government, but it is serviced by the Ventura County Sheriff's Department and the Ventura County Fire Department. The Somis ZIP Code, 93066, includes a large area of surrounding agricultural lands bounded on the south by the edge of housing tracts in Camarillo and on the north by the ridge line of South Mountain, 6 miles (9.7 km) north of Los Angeles Ave. The Zip code encompasses an area some 11 miles (18 km) in width in the east-west direction.

The Bear Valley post office operated from 1858 to 1912, from 1914 to 1919, and from 1933 to 1955. In 1847, John C. Frémont, a veteran of the Bear Flag Revolt, decided to settle down in the San Francisco Bay Area. Desiring a ranch near San José, California, he sent $3,000 to the American consul Thomas O. Larkin. Instead of his intended purchase, he was sold Rancho Las Mariposas, consisting of 44,387 acres (179.6 km2) in the southern Sierra Nevada foothills around Bear Valley. The original Mexican grant was a ""floating grant"", a grant of land for which the area was precisely given but the actual boundaries were left unspecified (usually due to inadequate surveys of the areas involved). After the beginning of the California Gold Rush in 1848, Fremont moved his grant's borders into the hills. Those hills proved to be lucrative and his mining operations centered in Bear Valley. At its peak, Bear Valley had a population of 3,000. During 1850-60 when Frémont's Pine Tree and Josephine Mines were producing, Frémont built an elegant hotel, Oso House; the structure, like many in the area, burned in the late 19th century. Frémont lived and worked in the city, and his large home was nicknamed the Little White House, coincidentally built two years after he was the first Republican Party candidate for US President; the home burned in 1866."

Timber was harvested for use by the railroad. Coal was mined at the time in Carbondale. Ancient sea life fossils can be found within the sandstone cliffs in the area. During Spanish rule, the canyon was visited by Spanish explorers and was known by the name Cañada de la Madera (Timber Canyon). The town in Spain by that name bears a remarkable resemblance to Silverado. (The name Silverado is a type of Spanglish indicating a place where silver is found; a parallel formation to El Dorado.) The area enjoyed a renaissance in popularity in the 1940s as a hot springs vacation retreat, during which time hotels and restaurants prospered. A large number of weekend cabins were also built at that time. Home to a number of artists and craftsmen, the town now consists of about 2000 residents, a general store, a cafe, a public library, a church, two fire stations, a community center, and a post office. It hosts summer concerts, an annual Country Fair, and an Easter breakfast. A local landmark near Silverado is Cook's Corner, popular with motorcyclists. Torrential rains from Pacific storms in 1939, and again in 1969, washed away homes and devastated roads and bridges. The latter storm resulted in a number of flood related casualties. On October 26, 2007, the Orange County Fire Authority issued a mandatory evacuation of the area due to the Santiago Fire. In September of 2014, a fire burned approximately 1000 acres within the canyon. However, no structures were lost. Today new homes and developments from nearby urban areas are encroaching on the canyons. The largest proposed projects are by the Irvine Company, which plans to build two developments stretching along Santiago Canyon Road from Jamboree Road past Irvine Lake."

When the bark from the ""Discovery Tree"" was removed and taken on a tour around the world, the trees soon became a worldwide sensation and one of the county's first tourist attractions. The uncommon gold telluride mineral calaverite was discovered in the county in 1861 and is named for it. Mark Twain set his story, ""The Celebrated Jumping Frog of Calaveras County"", in the county. The county hosts an annual fair and Jumping Frog Jubilee, featuring a frog-jumping contest, to celebrate the association with Twain's story. Each year's winner is commemorated with a brass plaque mounted in the sidewalk of downtown Historic Angels Camp and this feature is known as the Frog Hop of Fame.

Situated in Southern California, Los Angeles is known for its mediterranean climate, ethnic diversity, sprawling metropolis, and as a major center of the American entertainment industry. Los Angeles lies in a large coastal basin surrounded on three sides by mountains reaching up to and over 10,000 feet (3,000 m). Historically home to the Chumash and Tongva, Los Angeles was claimed by Juan Rodríguez Cabrillo for Spain in 1542 along with the rest of what would become Alta California. The city was officially founded on September 4, 1781, by Spanish governor Felipe de Neve. It became a part of Mexico in 1821 following the Mexican War of Independence. In 1848, at the end of the Mexican–American War, Los Angeles and the rest of California were purchased as part of the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, thereby becoming part of the United States. Los Angeles was incorporated as a municipality on April 4, 1850, five months before California achieved statehood. The city experienced rapid growth with the discovery of oil. The city is the focal point of the larger Los Angeles metropolitan area and the Greater Los Angeles Area region, which contains 13 million and over 18 million people, respectively, as of 2010, making it one of the most populous metropolitan areas in the world as well as the second-largest in the United States. Los Angeles is the seat of Los Angeles County, the most populated county in the United States. The city's inhabitants are referred to as Angelenos. Nicknamed the City of Angels, Los Angeles is a global city with a diverse economy in entertainment, culture, media, fashion, science, sports, technology, education, medicine and research. It has been ranked sixth in the Global Cities Index and 9th Global Economic Power Index. The city is home to renowned institutions covering a broad range of professional and cultural fields and is one of the most substantial economic engines within the United States. The Los Angeles combined statistical area (CSA) has a gross metropolitan product (GMP) of $831 billion (as of 2008), making it the third-largest in the world, after the Greater Tokyo and New York metropolitan areas. Los Angeles includes Hollywood and leads the world in the creation of television productions, video games, and recorded music; it is also one of the leaders in motion picture production. Los Angeles hosted the Summer Olympic Games in 1932 and 1984, and is currently bidding for the 2024 Summer Olympics."

Anaheim was the first city, incorporated in 1870, when the region was still part of neighboring Los Angeles County. Whereas most population centers in the United States tend to be identified by a major city, there is no defined urban center in Orange County. It is mostly suburban except for some traditionally urban areas at the centers of the older cities of Anaheim, Fullerton, Huntington Beach, Orange, and Santa Ana. There are several edge city-style developments such as Irvine Business Center, Newport Center, and South Coast Metro. The county is famous for its tourism as the home of attractions like Disneyland, Knott's Berry Farm, and several beaches along its more than 40 miles (64 km) of coastline. It is also known for its political conservatism — a 2005 academic study listed three Orange County cities as among America's 25 most conservative, making it one of two counties in the nation containing more than one such city. (Maricopa County, Arizona also has three cities on the list.) It is part of the Tech Coast. Orange County was at one time the largest county to have declared bankruptcy. In 1994, longtime treasurer and Democratic party politician Robert Citron's investment strategies left the county with inadequate capital to allow for any rise in interest rates for its trading positions. When the residents of Orange County voted down a proposal to raise taxes in order to balance the budget, bankruptcy followed soon after. Citron later pleaded guilty to six felonies regarding the matter."

Upon landing in San Diego Bay in 1542, Juan Rodríguez Cabrillo claimed the entire area for Spain, forming the basis for the settlement of Alta California 200 years later. The Presidio and Mission of San Diego, founded in 1769, formed the first European settlement in what is now California. In 1821, San Diego became part of newly independent Mexico, and in 1850, became part of the United States following the Mexican–American War and the admission of California to the union. The city is the seat of San Diego County and is the economic center of the region as well as the San Diego–Tijuana metropolitan area. San Diego's main economic engines are military and defense-related activities, tourism, international trade, and manufacturing. The presence of the University of California, San Diego (UCSD), with the affiliated UCSD Medical Center, has helped make the area a center of research in biotechnology."

San Francisco is the fourth-most populous city in California, after Los Angeles, San Diego and San Jose, and the 13th-most populous city in the United States—with a Census-estimated 2014 population of 852,469. The city and its surrounding areas are known as the San Francisco Bay Area, and are a part of the larger OMB designated San Jose-San Francisco-Oakland combined statistical area, the fifth most populous in the nation with an estimated population of 8.6 million. San Francisco (Spanish for Saint Francis) was founded on June 29, 1776, when colonists from Spain established Presidio of San Francisco at the Golden Gate and Mission San Francisco de Asís named for St. Francis of Assisi a few miles away. The California Gold Rush of 1849 brought rapid growth, making it the largest city on the West Coast at the time. San Francisco became a consolidated city-county in 1856.After three-quarters of the city was destroyed by the 1906 earthquake and fire, San Francisco was quickly rebuilt, hosting the Panama-Pacific International Exposition nine years later. In World War II, San Francisco was the port of embarkation for service members shipping out to the Pacific Theater. After the war, the confluence of returning servicemen, massive immigration, liberalizing attitudes, along with the rise of the ""hippie"" counterculture, the Sexual Revolution, the Peace Movement growing from opposition to United States involvement in the Vietnam War, and other factors led to the Summer of Love and the gay rights movement, cementing San Francisco as a center of liberal activism in the United States. Politically, the city votes strongly along liberal Democratic Party lines. San Francisco is a popular tourist destination, known for its cool summers, fog, steep rolling hills, eclectic mix of architecture, and landmarks including the Golden Gate Bridge, cable cars, the former Alcatraz Federal Penitentiary, Fisherman's Wharf, and its Chinatown district. San Francisco is also the headquarters of five major banking institutions and various other companies such as Levi Strauss & Co., Gap Inc., Salesforce.com, Dropbox, Reddit, Square, Inc., Dolby, Airbnb, Weebly, Pacific Gas and Electric Company, Yelp, Pinterest, Twitter, Uber, Mozilla, Wikimedia Foundation, and Craigslist. It has several nicknames, including ""The City by the Bay"", ""Fog City"", ""San Fran"", and ""Frisco"", as well as older ones like ""The City that Knows How"", ""Baghdad by the Bay"", and ""The Paris of the West"". As of 2015, San Francisco was ranked high on world livability rankings."

San Luis Obispo County (locally, SLO County) comprises the San Luis Obispo-Paso Robles-Arroyo Grande, CA Metropolitan Statistical Area. The county is located along the Pacific Ocean in Central California, between Los Angeles and the San Francisco Bay Area. The county's distance from the large metro areas of San Francisco and Los Angeles has helped it to retain its rural character and reminders of old California abound. Commonly referred to as ""the Central Coast,"" the area is more rural and agricultural than many other coastal regions in California. Father Junipero Serra founded the Mission San Luis Obispo de Tolosa in 1772 and the Mission is today an active part of downtown San Luis Obispo (popularly referred to as SLO or SLO-town). The small size of the county's communities, scattered along the beaches, coastal hills, and mountains of the Santa Lucia range, provides a wide variety of coastal and inland hill ecologies to support many kinds of fishing, agriculture, and tourist activities. The mainstays of the economy are California Polytechnic State University with its almost 20,000 students, tourism, and agriculture. San Luis Obispo County is the third largest producer of wine in California, surpassed only by Sonoma and Napa Counties. Wine grapes are the second largest agricultural crop in the county (after strawberries), and the wine production they support creates a direct economic impact and a growing wine country vacation industry. The town of San Simeon is located at the foot of the hill where newspaper publisher William Randolph Hearst built the famed Hearst Castle. Other coastal towns (listed from North to South) include Cambria, Cayucos, Morro Bay, and Los Osos (Baywood Park is considered to be Los Osos by the majority of locals). The city of Morro Bay and the village of Los Osos share the bay that has been made famous by Morro Rock. Surprisingly, the Village of Los Osos has a bigger population by roughly 4 thousand residents. These cities and villages are located northwest of San Luis Obispo city, and Avila Beach and the Five Cities to the south: Arroyo Grande, Grover Beach, Oceano, Pismo Beach and Shell Beach. Nipomo, just south of the Five Cities, borders northern Santa Barbara County. Inland, the cities of Paso Robles, Templeton, and Atascadero lie along the Salinas River, near the Paso Robles wine region. San Luis Obispo lies south of Atascadero and north of the Five Cities region. Just south of Cambria lies Harmony, one of the smallest towns in California with a population of 18."

It has 13 approved American Viticultural Areas and over 250 wineries. In 2002, Sonoma County ranked as the 32nd county in the United States in agricultural production. As early as 1920, Sonoma County was ranked as the eighth most agriculturally productive US county and a leading producer of hops, grapes, prunes, apples, and dairy and poultry products, largely due to the extent of available, fertile agricultural land in addition to the abundance of high quality irrigation water. More than 7.4 million tourists visit each year, spending more than $1 billion in 2006. Sonoma County is the home of Sonoma State University and Santa Rosa Junior College. Sonoma County is home to several Native American tribes. By the 1830s, European settlement had set a new direction that would prove to radically alter the course of land use and resource management of this region. Sonoma County has rich agricultural land, albeit largely divided between two nearly monocultural uses as of 2007: grapes and pasturage. The voters have twice approved open space initiatives that have provided funding for public acquisition of natural areas, preserving forested areas, coastal habitat, and other open space."

As of the 2010 census, the population was 514,453. The county seat is Modesto. Stanislaus County comprises the Modesto Metropolitan Statistical Area. The first European to see it was Gabriel Moraga in 1806. It was later named Rio Estanislao in honor of Estanislao, a mission-educated renegade Native American chief who led a band of Native Americans in a series of battles against Mexican troops until finally being defeated by General Mariano Vallejo in 1826. Estanislao was his baptismal name, the Spanish version of Stanislaus (Polish: Stanisław), itself the Latin version of the name of an 11th-century Polish Catholic Saint Stanislaus the Martyr. Between 1843 and 1846, when California was a province of independent Mexico, five Mexican land grants totaling 113,135 acres (458 km2; 177 sq mi) were granted in Stanislaus County. Rancho Orestimba y Las Garzas, Rancho Pescadero and Rancho Del Puerto were located on the west side of the San Joaquin River, and Rancho Del Rio Estanislao and Rancho Thompson on the north side of the Stanislaus River. Additionally, in 1844 Salomon Pico received a Mexican land grant of 58,000 acres (235 km2; 91 sq mi) in the San Joaquin Valley, somewhere near the Stanislaus River and the San Joaquin River in what is now Stanislaus County. However, the grant was never confirmed by the Land Commission. Stanislaus County was formed from part of Tuolumne County in 1854. The county seat was first situated at Adamsville, then moved to Empire in November, La Grange in December, and Knights Ferry in 1862, and was definitely fixed at the present location in Modesto in 1871. As the price of housing has increased in the San Francisco Bay Area, many people who work in the southern reaches of the Bay Area have opted for the longer commute and moved to Stanislaus County for the relatively affordable housing."

Its Spanish name was La Cañada de las Uvas, i.e. Grapevine ravine. The Grapevine was infamous for its high accident rate before the road was straightened and widened during 1933–34 by the three-lane Ridge Route Alternate (US 99). There are escape ramps branching off both sides of the downward part of the road for heavy trucks whose brakes fail on this very long, 6% steep and now straight grade. The road is still occasionally closed due to heavy snowfall during winter storms. It has also been closed for fire and, in October and December, 2015, mudslide. As the Grapevine is the major route between Central and Southern California, any closure is a major disruption to traffic along the West Coast. The top of the Grapevine is registered as California Historical Landmark #283, where Don Pedro Fages passed through in 1772 during his explorations through California. In 1955, Charlie Ryan wrote and performed a popular song known as ""Hot Rod Lincoln"", about a teenager who races his souped-up Lincoln against a Cadillac up the Grapevine hill. While Ryan never drove up the Grapevine, this song was inspired by his own experience racing a friend between Coeur d'Alene and Lewiston, Idaho. The song was an answer to the 1951 song ""Hot Rod Race"" by Arkie Shibley, referring to the same stretch of road in central California. The ZIP Code is 93203, and the community is inside area code 661. A post office operated at Grapevine from 1923 to 1960. The community of Wheeler Ridge lies three miles north of Grapevine on Interstate 5, with Lebec nine miles south."

The U.S. Geological Survey, Geographic Names Information System shows a feature ID of 242167 for the community, making its existence official. The Spottiswood post office opened in 1888, changed its name to Famoso in 1895, closed for a period in 1919, moved in 1940, and closed for good in 1946. The name Poso was bestowed by the Southern Pacific Railroad when it reached the site in the 1870s. Famoso is a Spanish word meaning ""famous"" or ""celebrated"". Early in its history, the city of Famoso was named Poso, California. This name conflicted with the community of Pozo along the Butterfield Overland Mail stagecoach route in San Luis Obispo County and officials in Washington renamed it Spottiswood. The residents later requested the name to be changed to Famoso, meaning ""famous"" in Spanish. The route of an early irrigation project, the Pozo Canal, is visible from aerial photos of this area. Poso Creek flows to the northwest, passing immediately north of town. The eastward continuation of SR 46, Famoso Woody Road, leads into the Sierra foothills, passing through the Mount Poso Oil Field on the way. The westward continuation leads to the city of Paso Robles, California in San Luis Obispo County. The town is famous for its nut groves and especially the race track - Auto Club Famoso Raceway (Famoso Raceway). The ZIP Code is 93250, and the community is inside area code 661."

Although the town was 10 miles (16 km) distant at that time, the City of Ventura grew so the community is now just outside the city limits. The commercial district known as Old Town Saticoy is surrounded by a residential neighborhood with a population of just over one thousand. Two historic buildings attest to the important role Saticoy once held in the local agricultural economy: Walnut Growers Association Warehouse, and Saticoy (Lima) Bean Warehouse. The historic setting, stable residential population, railroad, and access to major highways make this community unique in Ventura County. State Route 118 curves through the southerly portion of the townsite although it formerly followed a zig-zag route through the business district. State Route 118 heads northwest as Wells Road to terminate at the Santa Paula Freeway (State Route 126). Los Angeles Avenue is the name given to the highway as it heads east to connect with State Route 232. South towards the Santa Clara River is a sizable industrial area located on both sides of Los Angeles Avenue. The historic building that formerly housed the Farmers & Merchants Bank of Santa Paula, Saticoy Branch, stands at a quiet intersection that used to be at the center of a vibrant community. For statistical purposes, the United States Census Bureau has defined Saticoy as a census-designated place (CDP). The census definition of the area does not precisely correspond to the local understanding of the historical area of the community. Saticoy is near an apex of this compound alluvial fan formed by the river and Calleguas Creek. The Santa Clara River Valley opens up into the Oxnard Plain here as South Mountain on the south shore marks the end of the valley. Located on the fertile north bank of the Santa Clara River the shore of the Santa Barbara Channel is some 8 miles distant. Agriculture in the area includes avocados, lemons, oranges, strawberries, and many other row crops. Along the shore of the Santa Clara River, amidst the agriculture area east and northeast of the town, is the Saticoy Oil Field, discovered in 1955 and operated by Vintage Petroleum."

While Sky Londa is the spelling approved by the U.S. Board of Geographic Names, a frequently used state government variant spelling is Skylonda. The variant spelling is used on a Caltrans sign for southbound SR35 north of SR84 and on the name of a CDF Fire station in the community. This variant name is also shown as a variant in the National Geographic Names Database. The 1994 USGS 7.5-minute quadrangle, Woodside, California shows it spelled Sky Londa. Maps recorded as early as 1909 show it as Sky L'onda apparently derived from the crossroad names Skyline Boulevard and Woodside-La Honda Road. The 7.5-minute quadrangle, Woodside, California, (1994), shows Woodside VOR north of the settlement. The aircraft navigation facility is shown as being outfitted with distance measuring equipment. It lies one mile (1.6 km) at 285 degrees off true north from the intersection of SR35 and SR84. Its identifier is ""OSI"" and publicly available FAA documents show the VOR signal is on 113.9 MHz. Many of the area's characteristic redwood-log homes were first built in the early 1930s by a developer who subdivided a few tracts and established a water supply and reservoirs dedicated to the new community. The redwood ""logs"" came from unused railroad-tie stock sawn by a mill located at the intersection until the Depression. The local water is still pumped from wells and La Honda Creek, and delivered to 154 homes by the Sky L'onda Mutual Water Company. There are a few commercial establishments at the intersection of SR35 and SR84, including two service stations, a convenience store, a real estate office, a small events center, and one restaurant. The restaurant is called Alice's Restaurant, but it is not the one mentioned in Arlo Guthrie's famous song.

The San Bernardino City Council is considering another redevelopment effort. The city’s Economic Development Agency presented the council with a draft of the Downtown Core Vision / Action Plan in 2009. – a guide for revitalizing downtown San Bernardino for the next 10 years. The plan is the culmination of a year of research, community participation, and planning led by the city’s EDA and the urban planning firm EDAW. The city is discussing the construction of a new government center/civic plaza that will contain an iconic 24 story tower. On May 11, 2014 the county of San Bernardino opened a 12 story, 200-foot-tall courthouse known as the San Bernardino Justice Center. The county will consolidate many county-wide court functions in the new structure, which is the tallest building in San Bernardino and the Inland Empire. In an attempt to revitalize the downtown area, youth organizations such as the San Bernardino Generation Now and CSUSB student groups are engaged in the Revolve Project. The groups plan to restore a sense of ""Pride of ownership"" to the city beginning with the Downtown Summer Fest in San Bernardino, creating attention for the beauty of the Downtown district. This group uses catchy Hash tags to grab the attention of many, such as #WeLoveSB14 and #WeLoveSanBernardino. The San Bernardino Generation Now movement is catching the attention of many as the city begins to rebuild and new businesses begin to look at the Downtown area as an open canvas of opportunity."

The town was built in 1905 specifically as a railroad station along the rail line between Utah and Los Angeles, originally called ""Siding 16,"" because of its location and nearby springs that provided abundant water. Starting off as what was a simple train depot in the 1920s, the town of Kelso boomed briefly to as many as 2000 residents in the 1940s, when borax and iron mines opened nearby. Gold and silver were also discovered in the nearby hills of what became known as the Kelso district. The town shrank again when the mines closed after about a decade. Kelso was a base of operations for the San Pedro, Los Angeles and Salt Lake Railroad, connecting track of Union Pacific Railroad, to which the SPLA&SL had negotiated trackage rights, with the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway east-west line to the south. Here, trains were watered and ""helper"" locomotives were attached to assist the regular trains in climbing the steep Cima Hill. The distance between Las Vegas and the connection with the Santa Fe line at Daggett was too far for trains without a meal car, so Kelso was a convenient spot for a restaurant stop. The depot building itself was built in 1923 using a Spanish ""California mission"" building style. It contained boarding rooms for railroad employees and a restaurant for both employees and passengers. It also had a telegraph office and waiting room. Later, a restaurant nicknamed the ""Beanery,"" that served home-style meals was housed in the building. The large rooms in the basement also served as a community center for local residents. The depot remained in operation until 1986. Left to the harsh conditions in the desert, the building began to deteriorate. By the mid-1990s the railroad was on the verge of demolishing the depot. Preservationists then stepped in to save it. It was recently renovated to become the Mojave National Preserve's visitor center. Renovation was completed in 2005 and is now open to the public. During the 1970s Kelso was known as the town without television. About 75 residents lived in Kelso, many with school age children. Television signals could not reach the town which meant that residents found other methods of recreation. However, with the advent of satellite dishes, television was eventually introduced to Kelso. The ZIP Code is 92309 and the community is inside area codes 442 and 760. The Kelso Mountains are located north of Kelso, the Kelso Dunes lie to the southwest, and the entire area lies within the boundary of the Mojave National Preserve."

It was once a popular vacation destination spot before ever-increasing salinity and pollution of the Salton Sea shut the tourist trade down. The population was 3,477 at the 2010 census. The town traces its beginnings to 1958 when developers Ray Ryan and Trav Rogers purchased the land on which the town would sit and began to sell individual parcels in 1960. North Shore is notable as the home of the Sonny Bono Salton Sea National Wildlife Refuge. Established in 1930 by presidential proclamation and with an original area of over 35,000 acres (140 km2), only about 2,200 manageable acres (8.9 km2) remain due to flooding caused by the Salton Sea. A proposed system of dikes that will help control the increasing salinity of the Salton Sea will also serve to stop further encroachment on the refuge. One building is particularly noteworthy. The North Shore Beach and Yacht Club, an Albert Frey design, opened in 1962 and was in active use until 1984; rising water levels destroyed the jetty in 1981, thereby making it impossible for boats to dock there. As recently as the early 2000s, it was possible to enter the lobby prior to its being boarded up, although stairs leading to the second floor had been removed prior to its abandonment. The lobby was once littered with hotel receipts from the neighboring North Shore Motel (razed in 2008) dating back to the club's last days. The yacht club has been restored under a $3.35 million grant and since 2011 is open to the public as a Community Center and historical landmark. The Salton Sea History Museum was relocated to Mecca, California in February 2012. North Shore is accessible via State Route 111 at the Imperial County line. The wildlife refuge and campground is a short distance south of the town. The ZIP Code is 92254, and the community is inside area codes 442 and 760."

The 1872 Lone Pine earthquake damaged the smelters and uplifted the shoreline, rendering the Swansea pier inaccessible by Owens Lake steamships. As a result, most of the smelting and transportation business moved to Keeler, approximately one mile to the south. In the summer of 1874, a thunderstorm-induced debris flow inundated Swansea under several feet of water, rock, and sand. By then the town had been almost deserted, and the debris flow marked the end of Swansea. As of 2007, only one building and a smelter foundation remained alongside Route 136 (about 10 miles southeast of Lone Pine)."

The town, which is at the intersection of those Routes, is the Bigfoot capital of the world, and holds an annual ""Bigfoot Daze"" festival in September in honor of the creature, followed by various festivities in a local park. The roadhead of the Bluff Creek / Fish Lake Road, near which many alleged Bigfoot sightings and footprint finds occurred, is about 46 miles northeast, along Route 96. A non-commercial ""Willow Creek Bigfoot Landmarks: A Brief Touring Guide, plus BF Odds and Ends"" can be viewed online. The region is the location of the Willow Creek American Viticultural Area. Organic gardens and vineries abound and welcome travelers to try their wares. The upper Trinity River offers a classic Class III river rafting run with moderate rapids, followed by the Burnt Ranch Gorge, which is one of the toughest runs in the entire state. An Amazon reviewer of the 2013 found-footage horror film, Willow Creek, says, ""The endearing quirkiness of the town is captured very well in the iconography, the interviews (particularly with Steven S., the bookstore owner), and the food."" The Wikipedia review says, ""The two stop off first in Willow Creek ... where various locals talk to Jim's camera, warning them to keep out of the woods, singing ballads about Bigfoot, and generally enjoying their 15 minutes in the spotlight while Jim and Kelly have a blast ...."" Willow Creek was served for many decades by the weekly Klamity Kourier newspaper, which closed in 2006 and was quickly replaced by the Bigfoot Valley News also based in Willow Creek. The Bigfoot Valley News has since closed, but the regional newspaper, Two Rivers Tribune (www.tworiverstribune.com), opened in 1994 and is still going strong. Its news coverage area is from Burnt Ranch all the way to Happy Camp, 97.5 miles (by Routes 299 and 96) to the north."

It lies beneath the waters of the Lexington Reservoir above Los Gatos. The location is latitude 37.18N and longitude 121.98W. It was 551 feet (168 meters) above sea level. There are two different possible origins for the name of the town. The first is that the town was the location of a branch road that led to the New Almaden mine. The second, and more fanciful, origin is that the town was named after a local prostitute. The original town name registered with the Postal Service in 1861 was Lexington. It was re-registered as Alma in 1873. The town was mostly demolished when the James J. Lenihan Dam was constructed there in 1952. Alma, at the time, had a population of fewer than 100 people. The town was an important rail stop for the logging industry in the Santa Cruz Mountains as well as a stop for vacationers heading to the coast from the Santa Clara Valley. Just north of Alma was the town of Lexington, which had greatly declined by the time that dam and reservoir were constructed. Alma had a stage stop, hotel, saloons, small agricultural operations, general merchandise store, and lumber mills, as well as other establishments. The South Pacific Coast Railroad served Alma between 1880 and 1940, providing service between Los Gatos and Santa Cruz via Wrights, also known as Wrights Station or Wright's Station. Some foundational structures are only visible when the water levels drop in the reservoir, and some old roads and a bridge dating from 1926. The bridge can only be viewed when the water level is unusually low, such as the summer of 2008 when construction on the dam lowered the water level to 7% capacity. Modern day State Route 17 passes by the reservoir—beneath which lie the former towns of Lexington and Alma.

The main house of the Applegate Ranch was located where Oliver's gas station and bar sits today. Lisbon eventually returned to Missouri but his son, George W. Applegate, stayed.

Second growth forests exist mostly apart from cleared lands, which show some evidence of the extensive redwood forest that once existed in the form of large stumps. Some of the area's older Victorian era houses (many are very plain, early Gothic Revival examples), are still present on the Old Arcata Road, the original main road connecting Arcata to Eureka.

Huntington Beach (locally initialized ""HB"") is known for its long 9.5-mile (15.3 km) stretch of sandy beach, mild climate, excellent surfing, and beach culture. The ocean waves are enhanced by a natural effect caused by the edge-diffraction of open ocean swells around Santa Catalina Island. Swells generated predominantly from the North Pacific in winter and from a combination of Southern Hemisphere storms and hurricanes in the summer focus on Huntington Beach, creating consistent surf all year long, hence the nickname ""Surf City""."

The beachside community lies on a flat plateau about 30 feet (9 m) in elevation, separated from the beach by a bluff. Isla Vista enjoys a Mediterranean climate and often has slightly less precipitation than either Santa Barbara or the adjacent community of Goleta. Isla Vista is located on a south-facing portion of the Santa Barbara County coast, between Coal Oil Point and Campus Point in view of the Channel Islands. During El Niño years, precipitation in Isla Vista can be excessive and potentially dangerous. Some homes and apartments built on the south side of Del Playa Drive, most popular with students due to their direct ocean views, are in danger of collapse, since they are built on quickly-eroding bluffs thirty to sixty feet above the Pacific Ocean. Recent erosion has exposed foundation supports in several of the properties closest to the university campus, UCSB. As Isla Vista is on the south coast of Santa Barbara County, which has some of the highest housing prices in the United States, the student population shares densely packed housing with a working Hispanic population. Since Isla Vista has not been annexed by either Goleta or Santa Barbara, remaining unincorporated, only county funds are available for civic projects. Isla Vista is home to a student housing cooperative, the Santa Barbara Student Housing Coop, as well as a food cooperative, the Isla Vista Food Co-op."

Woodfords holds title as the oldest non-native settlement in the entire region. Sam Brannan left supplies near a spring here in 1847 on his way to Salt Lake City, and Brannan Springs, as it was then called, was ideally positioned to take advantage of traffic on the booming road to California. After a brief period during which the settlement was known as Carey's Mills, the Woodfords name came into common usage following the establishment of an official post office near a hotel by Daniel Woodford in 1849. Today, Woodfords continues to serve highway travelers, and is home to about 150 full-time residents, while the Southern band of the Washo tribe has a small community in nearby Diamond Valley. Woodfords became a remount station of the Pony Express on April 4, 1860, when Warren Upson scaled the mountains in a blinding snowstorm, reached Woodfords from Lake Tahoe via Luther Pass, and made his way down the eastern slope of the Sierra on his way to Carson City. Five weeks later the Pony Express was rerouted by way of Echo Summit and the Kingsbury Grade. The remount station is now California Historical Landmark #805.

Since the town started growing in population and resources, it has not stopped. The area was well irrigated due to the efforts of James Moore, and this drew people out to try their hand at farming. The endeavor was successful as people found the soil in the area very fertile. The city gained a federal post office and the next year the county seat was moved from Washington (present day West Sacramento, California) to Woodland after Washington was flooded. The addition of a railroad line, the close proximity to Sacramento, and the more recent addition of Interstate 5, helped create a thriving city."

There are numerous hiking trails for visitors to enjoy, with the Devils Slide Trail being one of the most popular as it also branches off with trails that lead to the Palm Springs Aerial Tramway; the trail has previously been called ""the backdoor to Idyllwild."" Idyllwild has earned the designation as one of the 100 Best Small Art Towns in America Idyllwild was also voted L.A.'s Best Mountain Getaway. The arts thrive in Idyllwild in the form of art, music, and theatre. In order to provide statistical information for Idyllwild, Pine Cove, and Fern Valley, the United States Census Bureau has defined Idyllwild-Pine Cove as a single census-designated place (CDP). The statistical information applies to the entire CDP, although local views of the community vary somewhat from the definition of the CDP. The population of the CDP was 3,874 at the 2010 census, up from 3,504 as of the 2000 census."

Modesto has been honored as a Tree City USA numerous times. It is surrounded by rich farmland; Stanislaus County ranks sixth among California counties in farm production. Led by milk, almonds, chickens, walnuts, and corn silage, the county grossed nearly $3.1 billion in agricultural production in 2011. Modesto was immortalized in the 1973 George Lucas film American Graffiti (none of which was actually filmed in Modesto). Lucas grew up in Modesto and graduated from Thomas Downey High School in 1962 and attended Modesto Junior College shortly after. The award-winning film captured the spirit of cruising and friendship on 10th and 11th Streets in 1962 and led to the revival of 1950s nostalgia that included the TV show Happy Days and the other spin-offs. Modesto is one of the birthplaces of modern rock and roll as the roots of Rockabilly music began in 1938 with the Maddox Brothers and Rose. The slap bass technique created by Fred Maddox became the percussive backbeat to ""hillbilly boogie"" that would become the foundation of Rock and Roll. The Maddox Brothers music became famous from the early broadcasts by pioneering radio station KTRB throughout the 1940s. Fred Maddox's bass now belongs to the Experience Project Museum in Seattle Washington for the significance in music history. The Gallup-Healthways Well-Being Index for 2011, which interviews 1,000 participants daily and asks individuals to assess their jobs, finances, physical health, emotional state of mind and communities, ranked Modesto 126 out of the 190 cities surveyed. In December 2009, Forbes ranked Modesto 48th out of 100 among ""Best Bang-for-the-Buck Cities"". In this ranking, Modesto ranked 8th in housing affordability and travel time but also ranked 86th in job forecast growth and 99th in foreclosures."

It is part of the El Centro, California Metropolitan Statistical Area. Although maps at first view show Salton City to be a sizable community, very few of the surveyed streets and roads were ever developed. The town was developed in the 1950s and established in 1958 primarily by M. Penn Phillips and the Holly Sugar Corporation as a resort community on the Salton Sea, a saline, endorheic rift lake located directly on the San Andreas Fault, yet very little development was achieved due to its isolation and lack of local employment opportunities. In the 1970s, most of the buildings constructed along the shoreline, including the city's marina were abandoned due to rising sea elevation. In the 1980s, the Imperial Irrigation District took proactive water conservation measures to reduce the flow of unused canal water into the Salton Sea. Throughout the 1980s and 1990s, as salinity and suspected pollution levels in the Salton Sea increased, the attraction of the Salton Sea as a recreational destination diminished. Most of the original tourist related structures fell during this time, including the Truckhaven Cafe, the Salton Bay Yacht Club hotel and restaurant, and the Holly House motel and restaurant (later renamed Desser House and then the Sundowner). In the 2000s, development in Salton City began to rise as a result of the escalating California housing market. Cheap land and housing costs, improvements to Highway 86, and a casino opened by Torres-Martinez Desert Cahuilla Indians attracted new residents."

There is a large Hispanic population, a group of Croats, Portuguese, Filipino, Caucasian, Sikhs and Japanese population that live and work in the city. The Pajaro Valley, wherein Watsonville is located, has a climate that is usually pleasant — around 60 to 70 degrees Fahrenheit throughout the year. This climate makes Watsonville an attractive coastal environment for the neighboring inland communities with very hot summers. The Pajaro Valley Unified School District has an attendance of about 18,000 students kindergarten through 12th grades. There are several private religious-based schools in Watsonville such as Notre Dame School, Monte Vista Christian, Salesian Sisters and St. Francis. There are also several charter schools and the non-religious independent Pre-K through 12th grade Mount Madonna School. These schools provide a wide range of educational options for local families. Watsonville is generally conservative on the political spectrum and average in relationship to the neighboring communities of Salinas, Castroville, and Prunedale. The larger coastal town directly north of Watsonville is the city of Santa Cruz. Santa Cruz is a draw for many young college students who attend Cabrillo College or University of California, Santa Cruz. Because Watsonville and Santa Cruz are beach towns, they draw many visitors from San Jose and from the Central Valley areas. Like neighboring Salinas in Monterey County, Watsonville produces a variety of fruits and vegetables, primarily apples, strawberries, blackberries, raspberries, and table mushrooms."

The town was founded by gold miners. Mining began in earnest in 1853, and town was shipping $100,000 in gold per month by 1858. After hydraulic mining was banned, the town entered decline. The town is now registered as California Historical Landmark #402."

Pinehurst today is a small weekend getaway for residents of Fresno and other central valley cities that want to escape the summer heat and enjoy total peace and quiet with their families. Many families have owned homes and property there for three generations. This cluster of cabins, small farms and a few ranches are in stark contrast to the weekend retreats of Oakhurst, Bass and Shaver Lakes, Three Rivers, and other small mountain communities because there are no motor boating lakes or ski resorts nearby. Pinehurst is nothing more than small streams, Pine, Cedar, and Oak trees, the Pinehurst lodge and a picturesque 20 minute drive to the Giant Redwoods of Sequoia and Kings Canyon National Parks. Just a few miles down highway 245 from Pinehurst are two other small neighboring communities called Miramonte and Badger, where the local school for elementary school aged children is located, as well as the post office that serves all three communities. The lands around Pinehurst and the other communities were originally established through the Homestead Act of 1862 by the Federal Government which allowed people to settle on land up to 160 acres (0.65 km2) for agricultural purposes only. Title was granted when farming took place. Most settlers around Pinehurst planted apple orchards to justify genuine settlement activity, and some of the original orchards can still be found at the Cedarbrook cabin area, the Pinehurst Ranch and other locations. Logging rights were not granted via the Homestead Act, therefore 16 years later in 1878, the Timber and Stone Act was passed. Land deemed “unfit” for farming was sold for $2.50 per acre to individuals who were allowed to conduct logging or mining on their property. Residency was not required and most buyers eventually transferred ownership to the large logging companies being established in the 1880s. The remnants of this activity over a hundred years ago can be seen around Hume Lake, Converse Basin and of course in several locations throughout Sequoia Park. Pinehurst, previously known as Neff's Mill, had its first sawmill located near the Cedarbrook picnic area (mill creek) and later was moved near to where the Pinehurst Lodge is located today. Cattle ranching, logging, fruit farming, the National Park and National Forest services were the mainstay of economic activity in and around Pinehurst for nearly 100 years. Today, recently planted apple and other fruit orchards can be found on several small farms around Pinehurst, yet nothing has changed much since the turn of the century except that logging as a business has nearly been banned in the area. Pinehurst and its surrounding communities of Badger and Miramonte may be some of the most untouched mountain communities in the state of California which were not affected by the real estate booms of the past 20 – 30 years—despite the fact that urban communities of almost one million people live less than 60 – 90 minutes away."

The sawmill was a major timber producer for the nearby town of Bodie, California. Lundy also had a mining camp that was established in 1879. The Lundy post office ran from 1880-1914. Like many gold rush camps, Lundy is now defunct. The building of a dam raised Lundy Lake, and part of the site where the community once stood is now submerged. Lundy is now a popular fishing resort. Electricity is provided via a small generator and facilities are rather primitive. Besides the main lake there are also three lakes accessible only by hiking and several beaver ponds. One of the popular attractions is the ""Indian Rock"" which is a large bolder painted with the portrait of an Indian chief in a full head dress near the first of the beaver ponds. Controversy has been attached to the rock due to people who were repainting it choosing their own color scheme instead of using the colors the original artist used. Pictures of the rock from when it was first painted or at least before it was repainted in the wrong colors are highly sought after to help restore the original color scheme. When driving into Lundy canyon one can see the last grave of what was once a large cemetery. One section of Lundy Lake is called Stagecoach Corner as a stagecoach missed the sharp turn and ended up plummeting into the lake. Many years ago scuba divers confirmed this myth by finding the stagecoach, preserved by the icy cold waters of the lake, lying on its side."

Wendling on the north fork of the Navarro River, at the present location of Navarro, and in 1905 the town of Wendling was founded around the mill; a post office was opened there in 1914. However, in 1916 the Wendling mill was bought by the Navarro Lumber Company, at which point Wendling became known as Navarro Mill or more simply Navarro.

With 87.2% identifying as being Caucasian in the 2010 U.S. Census, the Santa Susana CDP has the fifth highest percentage of white residents in Los Angeles County. The town by the Santa Susana Mountains in the Simi Valley was founded in 1903, shortly after the Southern Pacific Company built the Santa Susana Depot. It is also spelled Santa Susanna, while it is currently more commonly referred to as the Santa Susana Knolls, which is the officially designated name, or the Simi Knolls. The name of Santa Susana is now more generally applied to a larger area at the very east end of the Simi Valley (often called east of East Simi Valley) in easternmost Ventura County, which was the name of the early settlement located at Tapo Street and East Los Angeles Avenue that is now within the city limits. The historic Santa Susana Depot was located there before being moved farther east along the coast route railroad and made into a museum. The Simi Valley train station opened in 1993 about midway between the historic site and the museum location next to Santa Susana Knolls. The 2010 United States census reported the Santa Susana CDP's population as 1,037. It is a sparsely populated rural area with rustic housing and no set-houses, in a hilly and relatively forested part of the valley. The area was inhabited by the Chumash Indians as early as 500 AD and there have been numerous Chumash artifacts found in the area, in addition to the pictographs in Burro Flats Painted Cave. In the 1920s, the Knolls became home to brothels and also a religious cult. During the late 1960s Charles Manson and the Manson Family partially lived at Spahn's Movie Ranch. During the 1950s and '60s, the Corriganville Movie Ranch and other areas was utilized as movie sets for Western movies. Films and TV-series filmed here includes Gunsmoke, Bonanza, The Lone Ranger, Adventures of Superman, The Adventures of Robin Hood (1938), The Three Musketeers, Tales of the Texas Rangers, Billy the Kid Versus Dracula, Fort Apache, Star Trek, Wagon Train, and hundreds of other mostly Western-inspired movies and TV-shows. The rural Santa Susana is home to numerous species of native wildlife, including large amounts of snakes, coyotes, hawks and mountain lions."

The HOA fees are 244.00 per lot per year, to increase to 292.00 per lot, per year in 2016. The HOA does NOT regularly maintain the ""triangles"" but expects homeowners to, unless it regards a dead tree. They do not trim grass, vines or otherwise maintain their ""triangles"". Fencing is a huge issue as they expect the wildlife to have free range. While in theory, this is a nice thought, the wildlife in this area has access to 1100 acres of forest. Not being able to fence has caused security issues for some as well as mountain lion access to decks and other personal areas. Napa county has a leash law, which makes it very difficult to own a dog when you are not allowed to ""fence your yard"". Circle Oaks is isolated and ""country"" living, but one feels they own their home and rent their property. You are not allowed to have backyard chickens, even though you live in the country, or any other small livestock type animals. The rules are contradictory to the rest of Napa county, including the city of Napa, which does allow backyard chickens. (no roosters) There is a lot of wildlife in this area, including black tail deer. Anything you plant is food for them. If you like to garden, you will have to find a way to fence off your area or you are just growing deer food. They will jump a 6 ft fence to get to your veggies and fruits. Most lots are about 1/4 acre circle. Some are steep and mountainous while others are flatter. There is an abundance of trees, wild ferns and other beautiful flora. Circle Oaks is located in a wildfire danger area as well as an earthquake danger area. The community is very aware of fire danger and part of the rules require maintenance of your property to prevent fire danger. The HOA consists of a manager and 5 board members. They meet about once a month and homeowners are invited to attend. The water board is separate from the HOA. Your base water bill is 100.00, plus any usage. This is to pay for improvements made by the water board so that Circle Oaks doesn't run out of water. Most people don't have lawns and just let nature take over their land as a result of the water charges. Since our yards are strictly for wildlife usage, it makes no sense to put out expensive landscaping efforts, however, you do get to watch the deer. There are beautiful views in most of Circle Oaks. The drive on Hwy 121 is tedious with the tight winding road, bicyclers with no clearance and 20mph for a long stretch. But if you are lucky enough to be the passenger you are in for some amazing views of the vineyards, farms, land, trees and more."

To date, there are 173 developed lots with houses, including two condominium buildings with a total of 48 units. It is surrounded on three sides by Yosemite National Park and Sierra National Forest. Some homes are owned by permanent residents of the area while others are resort homes, some of which are rented on a daily and weekly basis by visitors to Yosemite National Park. These vacation rentals provide much needed funds for infrastructure repairs. Occupation of the Yosemite West area did not begin, however, with the subdivision that opened in 1967. It began many centuries earlier with the North American Indian Tribes of the Sierra. Before the advent of the white man, Indians used Yosemite West as their camp ground and hunting area. Even today, a search for the obsidian chips used as arrowheads can provide an interesting day outing in Yosemite West.

The new dining hall and classroom, as well as the circulation of students during their stay, would significantly improve the students’ indoor educational experience.

The city is located in the San Francisco Bay Area along the north bank of the Carquinez Strait. Benicia is just east of Vallejo and across the strait from Martinez. Elizabeth Patterson has served as Mayor of Benicia since 2007. The town can be divided into four areas: the East Side (east of First Street), the West Side (west of First Street), Southampton (the newer suburban neighborhoods north of Interstate 780), and the industrial park. Most of the town's older homes are on the east and west sides. Southampton contains primarily single-family housing developments and condominiums, most of which were built between 1970 and 2000. The East Side includes the Benicia Arsenal, a former United States Army armory, which was bought by the city and is now used for a variety of purposes, most notably as live-work spaces for artists. The Arsenal is home to several historic (ca. 1860) landmark buildings such as The Clock Tower, the Camel Barn, and the Jefferson Street Mansion. The industrial park lies to the northeast of the residential areas of the city, and includes the Valero oil refinery. The Benicia State Recreation Area is on the far west edge of the city. The main retail area in Benicia is First Street, which attracts out-of-town antique and boutique shoppers and those seeking small-town, historic charm. In 1987 Benicia was selected to participate in the California Main Street Program. Connections to Benicia include Interstate 680 from Martinez to the south and Cordelia Junction (Fairfield) to the north, and Interstate 780, Columbus Parkway, and other local roads from Vallejo to the west. Amtrak also runs past the city north towards Sacramento, but the nearest train station lies in Martinez across the Carquinez Strait.

Vallejo is home to the Six Flags Discovery Kingdom theme park, the now-defunct Mare Island Naval Shipyard, and the regional office for Region 5 of the United States Forest Service. The colleges and universities in Vallejo are California Maritime Academy, the Vallejo Center campus of Solano Community College, and Touro University California. Ferry service runs from a terminal on Mare Island Strait to San Francisco, through the BayLink division of SolTrans. Vallejo has twice served as the capital of the state of California: once in 1852 and again in 1853, both periods being brief. The State Capitol building burned to the ground in the 1880s and the Vallejo Fire Department requested aid from the Fire Department at Mare Island Naval Shipyard. As there were no bridges at that time, the Mare Island Fire Department had to be ferried across the Napa River, arriving to find only the foundation remaining. This was the first recorded mutual aid response in the state of California. Some of the first Europeans drawn to the Vallejo area were attracted by the sulfur springs; in the year 1902 the area was named Blue Rock Springs. It was also known as White Sulfur Springs and that was the name of the road leading to it from town, today shortened to ""Springs Road""."

The Miramar submarket consists of approximately fourteen million square feet of distribution, warehouse, office, and Miramar Road frontage retail related space. Miramar is one of San Diego County's most recognized real estate markets due in part to its central location, size, and traditional industrial characteristics. This market historically maintains one of the highest occupancy rates in the county. Recent occupancy rates were approximately 91%. Miramar was originally part of Scripps Ranch, founded by Edward W. Scripps. He named the home he built on the ranch Miramar in the 1890s, after Archduke Maximilian's castle Miramare in Trieste, Italy. The name eventually became applied to the surrounding mesa. Loosely translated from Spanish it means ""a view of the sea"". Before becoming a military base in 1950, Miramar was a small, isolated community centered on a railroad station. No buildings from the original Miramar survive."

Clark sold the property to the Washburn brothers in 1874, who built a larger hotel in 1876, adding to it later. Hotel keeper Jean Bruce Washburn named the resort property Wawona in 1883. The town is located on the south fork of the Merced River, at an elevation of approximately 1300 m (4000 feet). It is on State Route 41, the main highway from Fresno to Yosemite Valley. Wawona is the location of the historic Wawona Hotel, built by Washburn in 1876, with additional structures added into the early 20th century. A classic Victorian resort, it was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1987. This is the town nearest to Chilnualna Falls and the Mariposa Grove of Giant Sequoia. The principal trailheads into the southern Yosemite wilderness are located in Wawona. The Clark's Station US Post Office opened in 1878. In 1883 its name was changed to Wawona. The ZIP Code is 95389. The community is inside area code 209."

Although gold was discovered here in 1854, it didn't last long, but the town survived due to its position as an important point for supplies and machinery. D.D. Demerest established a foundry here in 1854, and others soon followed. Most of the stamp mills and a large part of the mining machinery erected in Calaveras and Tuolumne Counties were built at the Altaville Foundry. A brick schoolhouse was built at Altaville in 1858 and the townsite was established in 1873. A post office was established in 1904, closed in 1943, and re-established in 1944.

The town was served by the Sierra Railway's branchline to Angels Camp until 1935. Unlike most of the places with ""Carson"" in their names in the American West, Carson Hill is not named after explorer Kit Carson, but instead it is named for Sgt. James H. Carson, a member of Colonel Jonathan D. Stevenson's Regiment of First New York Volunteers. He happened to be in Monterey when the California Gold Rush started. Carson first made his way to Weber Creek near Placerville and then moved south with the Angel and Murphy brothers (founders of Angels Camp and Murphys, respectively). After splitting up at what is now Angels Camp, Carson's group headed south and panned at a small tributary of the Stanislaus River, which they found incredibly rich in gold. They named this portion Carson Creek. Carson himself decided to move on to other locations, but was unsuccessful. He returned to Carson Creek, but never really cashed in on the success. He died in 1853 of rheumatism, near poverty. The Morgan Mine was one of the richest mines in the area, so much so that the miners didn't even have to dig. They would simply blow up a vein and collect the pieces. The mine was also where one of the largest nuggets in the state was discovered, a 195 pound troy block of gold that was worth $43,000 at the time. One of the Gold Country's more colorful stories is reported to have occurred here (although several other camps lay claim to a similar tale) during the early days of the rush. The tale goes that a man who had lost his life in a mining accident was being buried in the local cemetery. As the services were being held, one of the mourners noticed something glittering in the newly turned earth of the open grave. The ceremony was forgotten as everyone, the minister included, quickly located a claim. The town's former name was transferred to another place several miles away, Melones, California. The name Carson Hill was also used by the post office in the nearby town of Irvine."

Whenever Beard was asked about a proposed name, he would reply ""you bet."" After much drinking, the miners decided that You Bet sounded just right. The town grew quickly. Soon, several stage lines connected it with Nevada City and other mining areas. By 1864, the town had 40-50 buildings, including hotels, stores, shops and saloons. That year, a schoolhouse was built between Red Dog, a mining town about 1 mile to the north, and You Bet with monies raised by subscription. A post office was established in 1868 and served the community until 1903. During the Civil War, You Bet was a strong Union town. In the 1862 elections, the You Bet vote was 121 for the Unionists to 6 for the Secessionists. In the 1864 presidential election, Lincoln received 86 votes and McClellan received 2. On April 24, 1869, the town was completely destroyed by fire. It was rebuilt, in part with buildings moved there from Red Dog, whose diggings were playing out. However, on September 7, 1873, fire again destroyed much of You Bet. By the turn of the 19th century, many of the town's residents had moved north about one half mile to be closer to the diggings. Mining drove You Bet's economy for over 80 years. Hydraulic mining (dislodging gold bearing ore from hillsides with water under high pressure) was prominent in the early days. Water was brought in by ditches and flumes, and the diggings were one of the largest in the state. The Sawyer decision in 1884 banned most hydraulic mining. It continued legally in areas where the mines could contain their refuse, or tailings. Local lore has it that it also continued illegally, aided by a telephone line from the Greenhorn Creek crossing which was used to warn miners that federal inspectors were coming so that they could turn off the water. Other miners turned to drift mining, tunnelling into rock and using explosives to dislodge the ore. By 1918, an estimated $3 million in gold (about $175 million at 2015 prices) had been mined. Few people remained in the area, many having moved to work in the hard rock mines in neighboring Grass Valley. The town experienced a revival between the wars, and commercial mining continued until World War II. Since then, there have been periodic efforts to revive commercial mining when the price of gold soars. Occasional prospecting has never stopped, especially in the spring when prospectors look for gold washed down by runoff from the Sierra. Today, You Bet is a community of about 50 residences located within a radius of a few miles from the old mining town. It has a community church, but no commercial establishments. It was declared a historical landmark in 1975. All that remains of the Gold Rush era are the scarred diggings, some of the ditches, and the historic cemetery, which contains gravestones dating back to the 1860s. Interments were resumed in the 1990s. The last remaining historic building, the old schoolhouse, was reportedly dismantled in the 1960s by squatters looking for lumber."
