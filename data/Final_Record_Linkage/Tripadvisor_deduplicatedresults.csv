A group of pals and I rented a houseboat and ski boat for August 7-10. We have not visited Shasta before by boat and are hoping some of you who know the lake will tell us the best places to park the houseboat. We rented a large boat that holds 13 people and some of them are wondering if there is a place where the banks are not so steep so that they may pitch a tent at night. Also, whic arms do you recommend we travel up? Which are your favorites? How about the fishing? With the lake low, I hope to find more beach for my pals that isn't so steep, so any of you who have been this year, please let me know! Any and all replies are greatly appreciated! -Fran over a year ago Problem with this question? Show all answers (1) Answer See all questions (6) Questions?

We flew in an R44 and flew over LAX for an hour or so doing some awesome plane spotting. It was right after the president was in town so we had to wait out a ground stop. I can't remember the pilot's name but he was a great guy and I'd like to fly with him again in November when I'm there. Do you have any way to figure out who I flew with? Thanks!
