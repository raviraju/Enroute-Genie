        "knownFor": "\u201c Great venue \u201d Reviewed December 24, 2015 This is my second time for a ballet performance here and both times, I had a lovely time. The center is perfect for performances, just the right size. The bathrooms are clean and there's an area where they sell refreshments as well as gift items and flowers at the ballet performance. Parking is no problem either inside the free lot. Helpful? Thank KWong55 Report"
