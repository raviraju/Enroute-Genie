        "knownFor": "\u201c Great fun for a hot summer day! \u201d Reviewed July 10, 2013 via mobile We brought the kids twice here while visiting relatives. The bouncy houses were fun but they spent most of their time on the water slides. For a hot summer day the water slides were awesome and the kids had a great time! The staff is friendly and the place is well equipped. Would definitely come again to beat the summer... More Helpful? 1 Thank elchaco Report"
