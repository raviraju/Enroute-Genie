            "On my August 2015 visit to Gus's, the jerky was from an outfit in Washington state. It was good. But, not as good as what Gus's has sold in the past under his own brand.",

My gf who loves jerky saw this place... So we stopped to have a look. Since my gf is not a lover of red meat she found some turkey jerky. After spending 50$ i have to say... Its the best jerky ever. Its worth the stop... More Helpful? 2 Thank Gerald M Report"
