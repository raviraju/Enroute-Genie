        "Great hall, even in the balcony the sound is still great. the entrance is very clear and the reception area is very comfortable.",
        "The California Theater has great acoustics. The Symphony was playing Verdi's Requium which is a glorious piece of music and not at all maudlin.",
        "This refurbished downtown theatre has been beautifully restored. The acoustics were excellent. Accessible by car and light rail."
