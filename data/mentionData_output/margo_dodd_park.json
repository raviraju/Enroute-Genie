        "This is a little chunk of dinosaur caves park which I have reviewed. I didn't know it even had a name...Next to Dog Doo Corner.",
        "Gorgeous cliffs, rocks, wildlife, etc. Sunsets are awesome. Neat park for birthdays or events. Saturday mornings there is usually an art show or something... love it here.",
        "Lovely park, history, views, flowers....perfect for anyone who loves the seaside, cliff walks, etc. nearby restrooms are clean, area very friendly.",
        "Nice, small park along the ocean. We stopped to just enjoy the view and pick up a geo-cache. Parking near by but could be a problem during high tourist season",
        "We so enjoyed sitting on the bench and watching the sunset. A beautiful place to just relax. Also, enjoyed walking down the steps to the beach."
