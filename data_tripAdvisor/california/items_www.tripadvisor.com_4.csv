Wine Tasting ” Reviewed January 8, 2016 We came across the Maritime Wine Tasting Studio while visiting the Northbeach San Francisco, California area. We are from the Napa area, so we enjoy wine. This bar is newly opened, but it was really a pleasant find. Nikita took care of us, and he was great. I highly recommend Maritime Wine Tasting Studio. Helpful?
